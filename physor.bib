            SymPy is an open source computer algebra system written in pure Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provide additional examples and further outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.

ENSDF provides evaluated experimental nuclear structure and decay data for basic and applied research. The activities of the NSDD network, the publication of the evaluations, and their use in different applications are described. Since 1986, the ENSDF and related numeric and bibliographic data bases have been made available for on-line access. The current status of these data bases, and future plans to improve the on-line access to their contents are discussed.",
